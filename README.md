# Calculator app using svelte, sveltekit, JSON, Typescript, SSR and API.
## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

# Here is the overview of the project

This simple calculator app built with Svelte. This perform the simple mathematical operations. Also using a SSR to compute all the computation by a HTTP POST request then return a response using json format.

## This is the layout of this project.

## Console log all the unseen operation
This will console log all the math operation we use. It will show continuously as long you are using the calculator then show the result.
